	<h2>Description</h2>
	<body>This guide explains how to set up a <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd webserver</a> using Docker swarm and few raspberry pis. The inspiration for this project comes from this <a href="https://github.com/ahaurw01/haurwitz.com/blob/master/archives/posts/2017-06-10_rpi-swarm.md">guide</a>, and although my setup is similar there is a few things I did differently that might be of interest.</body>

	<h2>Equipment</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Raspberry Pis</b> - I have three Raspberry Pi 4's (Model B). They are quite speedy for my purposes. I got them from <a href="https://www.buyapi.ca/">BuyaPi</a>.</li>
		<li><b>Gigabit Ethernet Network Switch</b> - The Raspberry Pi 4 (Model B) has a Gigabit Ethernet Adapter so this makes sense. However older models have a lower bandwidth so this could be overkill depending on what you've got</li>
		<li><b>CAT6 Ethernet cable</b> - Atleast one more than the amount of Pis you have. Mine are 1 ft in length and they are still a bit messy near my router.</li>
		<li><b>Raspberry Pi Tower</b> - <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07MW3GM1T/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">This tower</a> is nice. It's relatively sturdy and the setup is easy. Plus it's got a few fans.s</li>
	</ul>
