--- ELF headers ---

* Elf headers contains meta information about the binary

Fields of interest:
    e_ident: initial magic bytes that provide an answer for the OS on how to interpret
              and decode the files contents.
    e_type: identifies the file type. e.g: an executable or shared object file, …
    e_machine: specifies the required architecture for a file. e.g: x86-64, ARM, MIPS, …


--- Program headers ---

* Describes the segments that are present within a binary
* Segments describe the memory layout of an executable and are understood by the kernel
* Program headers are necessary for executable files. They are not meant for object files
  because object files are not loaded directly into memory, rather they are linked by
  the compiler

Fields of interest:
    p_type: identifies the type of the segment. e.g.: loadable segment, dynamic linking tables, …
    p_flags: specifies the attributes/permissions of the current segment. e.g.: 0x3 for R+W permissions
    p_offset: contains the offset of the segment from the beginning of the file
    p_vaddr: contains the virtual address of the segment in memory
    p_paddr: reserved for systems with physical addressing
    p_filesz: contains the size of the file image of the segment
    p_memsz: contains the size of the memory image of the segment
    p_align: some alignment bytes with the power of 2
