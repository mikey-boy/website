I saved reading the Brothers Karamazov until my early twenties, believing that some of the concepts would pass over my head otherwise. I was probably right. At the time when I started reading Dostoevsky, I had a particular distain for religion. The years of forced Sunday service had slowly withered me down, and besides, I was about to enter university. What need did I have for religion? What role could it possibly have in my beliefs?

In its essence, the Brothers Karamazov is a debate. What is worth pursuing: spirituality, truth and reason, or earthly pleasures? Each of these positions is embodied by one of the Karamazovs, and their arguement is posited through their actions. Like in many of his other books, Dostoevsky masterfully creates these fictional characters, and each carries their own set of beliefs and afflictions. In the end, the reader can decide which life is better and whether Dostoevsky's own conclusions are justified.

Of course so much has already been said about this novel. My own experiences towards it are probably typical of many others (though I tried to limit my exposure to what others had to say while reading it). In the end, this novel allowed me to think about and question certain aspects of faith, a task that is necessary if one is ever able to obtain a certain degree of spirtual knowledge.
